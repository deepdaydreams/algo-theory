# [Algo Theory](http://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory/) 

Algo Theory is a project using a similar visual framework as Seeing Theory by Daniel Kunin. The goal of the project is to make algorithms more accessible to a wider range of students through interactive visualizations.

## About

Using Mike Bostockâ€™s data visualization software, D3.js, Algo Theory visualizes the fundamental concepts covered in an introductory college computer science class, comparable to the level of Stanford's CS 106B. Students are encouraged to use Algo Theory as an additional resource to their textbook, professor and peers.
